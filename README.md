 # PHPSimple IDE

The PHPSimple IDE aims to make it easier to develop and learn the PHP language.

Beginners in programming can learn and practice the language easily and intuitively without complications.

When using common PHP development methods, it can be confusing for new users in the field.

For example, developing using XAMPP along with Visual Studio can create confusion for beginners.
